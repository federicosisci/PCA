# PCA

Hi, we are Federico Sisci and Valeria Bo. 
In this project, we analyze a dataset containing informations about supermarket customers such as birth's date or types of purchases. After applying preprocessing techniques, we use the Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dataset's dimensonality.
After interpreting and analyzing the PCs found, we use clustering techniques such as k-menas with the best configuration of the hyperparameters. Then we provide a practical interpretation of the clusters found to indicate real customer segments on which to base business strategies. 
In particular we focused on the usefulness of applying two different scalers as we obtain different but real customer segments.
