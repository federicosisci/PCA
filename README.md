# PCA

Hi, we are Federico Sisci and Valeria Bo. 
In this project, we analyze a dataset containing informations about supermarket customers such as birth's date or types of purchases. After applying preprocessing techniques, we use the Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dataset's dimensonality.
